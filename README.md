# Missing 'then' Clause in Tcl's if Statement

This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl: omitting the `then` keyword in an `if` statement.  The code in `bug.tcl` shows the incorrect syntax. The corrected version is in `bugSolution.tcl`. This can lead to unexpected results or errors.  The corrected version uses the correct `if then` structure.
